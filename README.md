# My MERN Stack Project - SharePlaces App:

**SharePlaces**: This fullstack web application allows people to share their travel experience to a community of other travellers using this application.

_I have done this project using the tools I was given in courses I took in udemy and Shecode_

Motivation for this project:

-Encourage my friends to travel and share their impressions of places they had visited
-Gain more experience with FullStack development especially with MERN architecture

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node
